Working in pairs

Modeling of an XML database for the information system of a cook/recipe box company.  You can find descriptions of such companies on their websites (e.g. HelloFresh), also from the BBC Good Food newspaper review.

You need to consider the management of recipes and menus, ingredients, orders, customer feedback, delivery staff... The description of recipes and ingredients must integrate different aspects: for example, gastronomy, health, budget, etc.

- Write an XML schema that formalizes your model.
- Write an XML document validated against this document model, containing a representative- extract of the data.
- Imagine 3 scenarios requiring the visualization of part of this XML data in the text format- of your choice (e.g. HTML), and write 3 XSLT stylesheets for this (processing involves using- XSL templates in your stylesheet). For HTML output at least, provide a CSS stylesheet and- insert the processing instruction automatically via the XSLT stylesheet.
- Imagine a 4th scenario involving the use of some of this XML data in a new XML structuring,- and write a stylesheet to automatically generate this new XML database. Produce the XML- schema for your output data.
- Imagine a 5th scenario involving the use of some of this XML data in a new structuring and in- JSON format, and write a style sheet to automatically generate this JSON database. Produce- the JSON schema of your output data.
- Imagine a 5th scenario involving the exploitation of some of this XML data, which you will- implement in a Java or Python program.
- Write a short report (max. 4 pages) describing your modeling choices and the advantages and- disadvantages of your modeling, as well as your scenarios and their implementation.
- Prepare a 10-minute powerpoint presentation of your project. 

You'll be judged on the quality and richness of your data schema (model genericity and finesse of constraints), the quality of the scenarios you've devised and the quality of your style sheets (don't limit yourself to things that are too simple, prefer a functional XSLT programming style that exploits XPath).
